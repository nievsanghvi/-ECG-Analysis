# ECG-Analysis
# Patient ECG Analysis

### Overview
This project is a Python-based application designed to analyze ECG (Electrocardiogram) reports uploaded by patients. It takes the raw ECG data (in a CSV file) as input, performs detailed analysis, and provides health insights and recommendations based on the heart's electrical activity.

This script uses libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **SciPy**, among others, to analyze ECG data in detail and detect abnormalities.

### Features
- Reads ECG data from a CSV file.
- Calculates important cardiac metrics (e.g., heart rate, variability, QRS intervals).
- Detects abnormalities such as arrhythmias or other irregular signals.
- Provides health consultation based on analysis.
- Saves the consultation report for the patient as a text file.

### Requirements
Ensure that you have **Python 3.13** or later installed.

Install the required Python libraries using the command:
```bash
